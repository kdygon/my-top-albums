          <p>
            <i>Badlands</i> is my top album by far because not only is Halsey giving
            a refreshing new sound to Pop, but she touches on subjects throughout
            the album that a good part of our generation can relate to. Even though
            there are many things she sings about that are still taboo for
            mainstream Pop music, her debut album was well received. Her lyrics
            range from talking about her mental health issues and bisexuality to
            legal marijuana. The entire album is strong from start to finish.

          <p>
            Probably one of, if not her best album to date, <i>Anti</i> is another
            great listen all the way through. It's a slower pace than many of her
            previous albums, with more edgy tracks than dance anthems. If you like
            good beats and a strong bass, this will be the one for you. By the end
            of the album there are more ballads showing off her vocals, so there is
            a good range with all of the songs.

          Being an electronic duo, you will (not surprisingly) find a lot of
          collaborations on this album with artists ranging from The Weeknd to Sam
          Smith and Lorde. The range between the songs themselves is fairly narrow
          with some being more focused on vocals than others, but pretty much every
          song is a something you'll find yourself nodding along to. If
          you like electronic/House music then you'll enjoy it but if that's not
          your thing, you might want to pass on this one.

          <p>If you like music that has the common theme of "fuck you, I don't need you"
          to it and don't mind some spoken word mixed in, then this is your album. This
          entire album is basically all about empowerment and I doubt you would be able
          to make it through without feeling a little more fierce and ready to take on
          the world. Plus there's a video for every song that's basically a cinematic
          masterpiece. So definitely check this out.

          <p>
          Though not necessarily a concept album, as the title suggests,
          <i>Storyteller</i> is highly narrative with each track serving somewhat
          like a chapter in a story. Just not necessarily the same story. As
          expected, her vocals are strong and commanding in each track showing off
          her range and signature sound. Many of the songs are about your typical
          woman scorn as well as love ballads in general, but there are also a few
          on the more comical side with unexpected narratives. A great album for any
          Country lover, with at least a few tracks that could appeal to
          you even if you're not that into Country music.

          <p>Similar to the style of ARTPOP, Lady Gaga's newest is something I could
          (and have) listened to on repeat for days. There's of course some fun dance
          songs, but she slows it down for the deep cuts and title track. There's even
          a surprisingly awesome collaboration with Florence + the Machine's Florence
          Welch. But as one would guess she keeps her running theme of songs about love,
          sexuality, and embracing who you are.

          <p>For me personally, this is a very bittersweet album. Being the last of the
          band's studio albums, the songs definitely are their way of saying farewell.
          Though it is not my favorite from them, it is more sentimental than any of
          the others. It's very slowed down and is more about saying what every fan
          needs to hear, a goodbye from a band that has been around over 20 years.

          <p>This album is really just more of the funky rock/pop that made Imagine
          Dragons so popular a few years back. The songs are all awesome and have just
          enough angst mixed into the fun. Personally I'm a bigger fan of the rock heavy
          songs but they are all a good listen.

          that there isn't as much variety as there could be, but if you want an album
          that's pretty much all upbeat songs, then this is great.

          <p>This album, just like the ones they've made before, is a really good
          mix of blues, folk, rock, and bluegrass. There are a lot of songs to jam to
          and a couple ballads to break them up. There is a bit of an electronic vibe
          to the album which is certainly new for them, and kind of refreshing that
          they are expanding their style. It has their signature sound with a little
          extra.

          <p>If you are a fan of bluegrass, Punch Brothers are probably already on
          your radar. This album starts off with a ten minute song which is
          absolutely beautiful and showcases the mastery mandolin playing of Chris
          Thile. The album probably won't be appealing to those who aren't a fan of
          bluegrass and folk, but for those who do, it will become a favorite.

          <p>This is definitely a good album for background music to whatever you're
          working on as well as something to blast while driving to work. It is super
          upbeat, but there isn't much variety because of that. I wouldn't recommend
          listening to it too much, since you could easily get bored of it. It is
          still a good one to keep coming back to from time to time though.

          <p>Country fans are probably the only ones who will have any interest in
          this album, but for those who are, you'll probably enjoy it. It has all
          the typical subject matter for a Country album, great guitar solos, and a
          variety of types of songs. It's one of those albums that makes you really
          want to blast it while driving down some backroads.

          <p><i>Petals</i> is a very slow and mellow album, and as the album title
          suggests, it has a feeling of delicacy to it. Elephant Revival is known for
          their unconventional instruments that they use, such as a washboard, and
          the "haunting, ambient" vocals of Bonnie Paine. It is an album centered
          around human emotion and it is beautiful to listen and relax to.
